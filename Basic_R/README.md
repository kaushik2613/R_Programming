1. Data Pre-processing

A. Handling Missing Values:
Description: Identifying and addressing missing data using techniques
like imputation, deletion, or filling with default values.
Objective: Ensure the dataset is complete and accurate

B. Removing Duplicates:
Description: Identifying and removing duplicate records to avoid
redundancy.
Objective: Maintain data integrity and avoid biased analysis.

C. Handling Outliers
Description: Identifying and managing outliers that may skew the
results.
Objective: Ensure that outliers do not disproportionately influence the
analysis.


2. Data Transformation
A. Normalization and Scaling:
Description: Adjusting the range of numerical features to a common scale
(e.g., scaling between 0 and 1).
Objective: Ensure that features contribute equally to the model.

B. Encoding Categorical Variables:
Description: Converting categorical variables into numerical format using
techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Objective: Make categorical data usable for machine learning algorithms


3. Data Reduction
A. Feature Selection:
Description: Determine the Six most influential attributes on target
attribute (with explanation). You do not necessarily need to drop the
remaining features. Your task is just to determine and show the Six most
influential attributes with detailed explanation.
Objective: Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and avoid overfitting.

4. Dimensionality Reduction:
Description: Using techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
to reduce the number of features while preserving important
information(>=90%).
Objective: Improve model performance and reduce computational
complexity

5. Aggregation:
To compress the data, numerous columns might be combined into one
feature.


5. Visualization

A. Perform 2 visualizations of the features with respect to target variable with
detailed explanation.
B. Perform the box plots before and after the data preparation.
